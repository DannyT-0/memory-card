<strong>MEMORY CARD REACT PROJECT</strong>

<strong>Project description/How to play</strong>
The memory card game was created as a project to help with my understanding and learning of React. The game is fairly simple.

<ul>
<li>You must click on the cards and remember which ones you had already clicked on. </li>
<li>If you can get through every card without clicking on any twice, you'll get the highest score possible, which is 12.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tech stack used</strong>

<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS/Javascript/REACT</li>

I used the technologies I used because I enjoy using React as a framework. It helps simplify the act of rendering components onto the page and allows me to bundle things in a way that lets everything flow together and make sense.

</ul>

<strong>Possible future additions</strong>

<ul>
<li>Improve UX/UI with play button</li>
<li>Render congratulatory animation for getting maximum score</li>
<li>Allow players to save their high scores in a list</li>
</ul>

<strong>Reflections</strong>
I'm not sure if I'd call it the most complex project I've worked on so far, but it felt challenging and I felt a sense of accomplishment finishing it. The challenges I faced were dividing my components properly. I had initially put a lot of my logic into a component that it wasn't meant for and had to refactor a bunch of the code later on. I'll be more mindful of the start of my projects and work now so I don't run into the roadblock again.
